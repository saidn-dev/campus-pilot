# Timetable Assistant

Turn a photo of your university timetable into an editable class list, catch clashes, and export it to your Google calendar so users get notifications.

 Many universities in Uganda still manage timetables manually using spreadsheets and paperwork.
This leads to:
•Lecturer conflicts
•Room allocation clashes
•Time-consuming timetable generation
•Frequent timetable changes
•Student confusion"

**Live demo:** https://saidn-dev.github.io/campus-pilot/ (sample data stands in for the AI; run it locally for real Gemma 4 results)

Gemma 4 reads the image and writes study tips. Plain rules in the browser handle conflict detection, so those results are exact.

## Features

- **Photo to table.** Upload a JPG, PNG, or WebP (max 15 MB). Gemma 4 lists each class with course, code, type, day, start, end, room, and lecturer. You can edit every field.
- **Conflict detection.** Rule-based checks in `web/analysis.js` flag:

  | Check | Rule |
  |---|---|
  | Clash | Two classes overlap on the same day |
  | Invalid time | Missing day, missing time, or end before start |
  | Duplicate | Same code and same times listed twice |
  | Tight room change | Less than 10 min between classes in different rooms |
  | Long stretch | 4 h or more of classes with less than 15 min between them |

- **Weekly grid** view of the timetable.
- **Study tips.** Gemma 4 suggests 5 to 7 tips based on your classes, the issues found, and your free gaps (08:00 to 18:00).
- **Calendar export.** Downloads `timetable.ics` with weekly repeating events until the semester end date you pick (16 weeks from today if left blank), plus a reminder 15 min before each class.
- **Local storage.** Your classes are saved in the browser's `localStorage`. Nothing is stored on the server.

## Stack

| Part | Files |
|---|---|
| Backend: FastAPI, httpx | `server/main.py`, `server/gemma.py` |
| Frontend: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS | `web/index.html`, `web/styles.css`, `web/app.js`, `web/analysis.js` |
| Model | `gemma-4-31b-it` through the Gemini API, with `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` as fallback |

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Python 3 and a free Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

<!-- TODO: add the clone command once the GitHub remote exists -->

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
```

On macOS/Linux, use `source .venv/bin/activate` and `cp .env.example .env` instead.

Then set your key in `.env`:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes | Gemini API key |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY_2` | No | Backup key, used when the first is rate-limited |
| `GEMMA_MODEL` | No | Main model. Default `gemma-4-31b-it`; `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` is faster |

## Run

On Windows:

```bash
run.bat
```

`run.bat` creates `.env` from `.env.example` if it is missing, then starts the server. On any OS:

```bash
uvicorn server.main:app --port 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000.

> **Note:** When the Gemini API returns 429, 500, or 503, the server waits 2 s and tries the next key, then the backup model.

## API

The server also serves `web/` at `/`.

| Endpoint | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/extract` | multipart form, field `image` | `{"classes": [...]}` |
| `POST /api/tips` | `{"analysis": {...}}` | `{"tips": [{"title", "detail"}]}` |

Gemma errors return HTTP 502 with a readable message, such as a missing API key or a timeout.
